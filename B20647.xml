            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>SHepherd <hi>Adonis,</hi> being weary of his sport,</l>
               <l>Return'd to the woods, where he used to resort,</l>
               <l>He let fall his crook, and he laid himself down,</l>
               <l>He envy'd no monarch, nor wish'd for no crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He drank of the brook, eat the fruit of the tree,</l>
               <l>Enjoying himself, from all cares was he free:</l>
               <l>He valu'd no nymph, were she ever so fair;</l>
               <l>No pride, no ambition, had he, nor no care.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as it fell out in oue evening so clear,</l>
               <l>A charming sweet voice he chanced to hear:</l>
               <l>He stood like a stone, nor one foot could he move,</l>
               <l>He knew not what ail'd him, but fear'd it was love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The nymph she beheld him with a modest grace,</l>
               <l>Seeing something appear, she disguised her face;</l>
               <l>She disguised her face, and unto him did say,</l>
               <l>How now, Mr. Shepherd, how came you this way?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Shepherd reply'd, and to her he said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I ne'er was surpriz'd at the sight of a maid:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When first I beheld thee, from all care I was free,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But now I am captive, my dearest, to thee.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O shepherd! O shepherd! leave not your free state,</l>
               <l>For love will entangle you in sorrow that's great,</l>
               <l>And distract your brain, that you ne'er can have rest</l>
               <l>Then incline not to love, for as yet you are blest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fair nymph of the wood, and thou charmer of man,</hi>

                  <hi>Thy beauty's so great, that I can't it withstand;</hi>

                  <hi>O pity, O pity, a wounded young Boy.</hi>

               <l>The nymph she reply'd, with a languishing look,</l>
               <l>Saying, Shepherd, alas! my way I mistook,</l>
               <l>Or you had never known me, nor I who you were,</l>
               <l>For now I do pity you, I do declare.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then sit thee down by me, thou beauteous nymph,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And let me enjoy thy sweet person, not glimpse</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Of thy beauty celestial, so charming and fair;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thy beauty indeed is beyond all compare.</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Will you let your poor shepherd thus languishing lie?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>If you grant me not love, all the world can't me save,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tho' once I did slight you, 'twill bring me to my grave.</hi>

               <l>With that poor <hi>Adonis</hi> let fall some few tears,</l>
               <l>His face looked pale, which discover'd his cares:</l>
               <l>The nymph looked red, and blushing did cry,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>O no, sweet</hi> Adonis! <hi>for me you shan't die.</hi>

                  <hi>Then take your shepherdess, I'll be no more coy,</hi>

               <l>The nymph she receiv'd him with looks most kind,</l>
               <l>And from her shepherd she comfort did find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then close he embrac'd her, and soft laid her down,</l>
               <l>The sky was their tester, their bed was the ground:</l>
               <l>He folded her so oft within his fond arms,</l>
               <l>Her face and her features discover'd her charms.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As charming as <hi>Venus</hi> was, when she was took</l>

               <l>Yet this nymph and this shepherd most beautiful fair,</l>
               <l>Like the light of the sun-beams so charming were.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Among the sweet groves thus they pleasant do live,</l>

               <l>It is there, it is there, it is there they do keep</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One sings with her voice, t'other plays with his flute,</l>

               <l>They look at each other so charming and sweet,</l>
